# Ergo Fleet Bulk Miner

This is meant to run server side. Just something quick I did in an hour for demo purposes. 

Make sure you have enough input boxes.

Each NFT mint requires 0.0021 ERG at minimum 

Make sure your address has N input boxes each at least containing 0.0021 ERG

You can use [this](https://github.com/mgpai22/ergo-wallet-duster) to create input boxes in your wallet
